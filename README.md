Gatekeeper
==========

We have a gate restricting access to our space. We had two remote controls. We have around 20 members and were in need of a good solution;

We hooked the remote control to a gsm modem, and put this script in the middle to regulate access. The script needs a (not included in this repo) file called "whitelist" containing the numbers allowed to open the gate:

> * 
> 32304985304 Some name 
> 32434985339 An another name
> 32473453939 Third name
> 32345843548 Lastname

If you include the "\*" this means all numbers are allowed, add it for "open nights"

This was developed for and by http://0x20.be. Constributers: Joren Six, Sandb, others...
